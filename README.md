# Pico 8 Template
> Batteries included

A nice pico 8 template to quickstart any project.
Organise your code as you want in the `./src` folder, add all the `require()` you need in `./index.lua` (watch out for the order) and compile your code in the `./game.p8` file !

## How to run the compiler

Simply run :

```bash
python3 ./p8_compiler.py ./game.p8 ./index.lua
```

Or in VSCode run the task named "compile".
